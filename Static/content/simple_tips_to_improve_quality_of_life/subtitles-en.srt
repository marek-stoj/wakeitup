1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,765
 How to survive the everyday madness 

2
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:07,161
 Have you ever wondered 

3
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,296
 why it is so difficult for us humans, 

4
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:11,561
 just to be comfortable or to sit? 

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,355
 Have you ever wondered 

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,526
 why it's the neck and shoulder muscles, 

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,726
 which often complain at the end of a long day? 

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,305
 In this chapter we will 

9
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:23,136
 examine some of these questions. 

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,005
 At the center of our investigation 

11
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:27,170
 is the attempt to demonstrate 

12
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,005
 like all movement units 

13
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,270
 of the body are interconnected 

14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,931
 and show how you 

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,070
 Your quality of life, 

16
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,270
 by following some 

17
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:39,536
 very simple mechanical principles 

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,400
 dramatically improve. 

19
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,085
 Chapter 1 - for the "lazy ones" 

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,565
 On the left you will see different 

21
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,100
 Incarnations average 

22
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:55,565
 Types of standing. 

23
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,000
 What do they have in common? 

24
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,465
 I think, two things: 

25
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,965
 The feet and the head. 

26
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,531
 The feet point laterally outwards 

27
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,100
 and if you look closely, 

28
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,800
 notice that the weight 

29
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,531
 of the body on the toes. 

30
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,090
 The head is rather far forward, 

31
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,231
 in front of the shoulders, moved. 

32
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,440
 Do you know how heavy your head is? 

33
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,631
 Guess, before I tell you. 

34
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,970
 Is it 500 grams, 1 kilo, 3 kilos? 

35
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:20,805
 Not quite... 

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,665
 The head of an adult weighs around 7 pounds. 

37
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,400
 This corresponds to about 9-10 beer bottles. 

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,365
 With an upstream head need 

39
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:30,535
 the shoulder and neck muscles 

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,175
 work every minute of wakefulness, 

41
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,731
 to keep that weight 

42
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,505
 and to prevent the head 

43
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:37,031
 - like Newton's famous apple - falls to the ground. 

44
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,300
 It may now start to make sense 

45
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,565
 why these muscles after a long day 

46
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,936
 hurt or complain. 

47
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:42,431
 But how can I do it? 

48
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,100
 in the demo on the right, 

49
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:45,936
 to keep the head much better, 

50
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,131
 without being too tense? 

51
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,300
 One of the secrets lies in the feet. 

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,965
 Take a closer look. 

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,831
 The feet are pointing straight forward 

54
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,436
 - the weight of the body falls more 

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
 towards the heels. 

56
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,231
 The feet affect the head position? 

57
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,065
 In fact they do. 

58
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,331
 The farther the feet point to the outside, 

59
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,301
 the more the head will fall forward 

60
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,631
 and must be stabilized by muscle power 

61
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,131
 or withheld. 

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,431
 A single day may not be big in there 

63
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,431
 Weight fall, but 10, 20, 30 years? 

64
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:19,131
 As you sit, so are you. 

65
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:21,231
 Why only we use 

66
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,100
 our feet are not intuitively correct? 

67
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:24,600
 One of the reasons is in the 

68
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,965
 Number of hours we usually 

69
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,565
 spend every day sitting down. 

70
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,400
 See how the legs in this "relaxed" 

71
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,531
 Sitting posture are turned to the outside? 

72
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,530
 The only thing that is the total collapse 

73
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,465
 of the body prevents 

74
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,136
 is the glass wall of the bus stop. 

75
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,635
 But look now: 

76
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,231
 The mechanical "trick" of a 

77
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:41,831
 upright posture is convenient 

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,665
 exclusively in one movement 

79
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,465
 of the pelvis over the hip joints. 

80
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,505
 To keep the spine in a more upright position 

81
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,200
 Position and the 7 kilos head 

82
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,805
 in appropriate balance 

83
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,300
 To be able to hold you have to pelvis 

84
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,965
 Set up as far as the weight 

85
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,375
 feel in front of the seat bumps. 

86
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,936
 Do not worry, you can not go too far 

87
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,265
 tilt forward, legs are in the way ... 

88
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:01,965
 What does all this have 

89
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,440
 to deal with our standing problem? 

90
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:05,500
 Well, if you have a long time 

91
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,660
 sitting so collapsing, 

92
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,331
 become the legs 

93
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,570
 get used to an external rotation. 

94
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,235
 If you then try 

95
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,965
 Just to put your feet, 

96
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,531
 it will feel uncomfortable. 

97
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,105
 Thus you stand with outward 

98
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,431
 Turned feet there, what 

99
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,465
 upright sitting makes it even more uncomfortable. 

100
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,336
 A downward spiral, which you 

101
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,170
 only with mindfulness or exercises 

102
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,770
 can escape. 

103
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,331
 The human body is certainly not 

104
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:30,100
 built for sitting so long 

105
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,640
 as we do today. 

106
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:36,800
 Go straight. 

107
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,935
 And sometimes we move 

108
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,435
 actually and even go. 

109
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,166
 When walking, the basic rule is the same, 

110
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,566
 which we discovered while standing. 

111
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:45,835
 Feet outwards means head forward 

112
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,140
 and feet just call your head more in balance. 

113
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:48,666
 In this example, observe 

114
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,466
 like the position of the feet 

115
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,600
 pull your head forward. 

116
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,100
 In contrast, Luděk 

117
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,235
 feet and knees straight forward. 

118
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,365
 This not only keeps your head upright, 

119
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,135
 but prevents the knees from rotating, 

120
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,200
 what prevents joint damage. 

121
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,401
 In addition, it works 

122
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:08,205
 that kind of walking 

123
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,130
 much more graceful than the other 

124
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
 and Luděk becomes his fellow man 

125
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,400
 act more controlled and pleasant. 

126
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:16,601
 For some people, 

127
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,800
 to acquire such a gait. 

128
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:22,235
 Go backwards a few steps and 

129
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,966
 then this posture 

130
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,635
 maintained in the forward direction. 

131
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,965
 Challenge stairs 

132
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,566
 When climbing stairs, the attitude 

133
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,935
 more importantly. 

134
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,835
 On the right side is the body 

135
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,866
 predominantly pushed up by the leg muscles. 

136
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,540
 Compare this 

137
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,300
 with the ease in the left example. 

138
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,066
 The idea of ​​a pitcher on the 

139
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,635
 To wear head or from above 

140
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,235
 to be pulled up on the skull roof 

141
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,835
 activates the muscles of the upper body 

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,566
 and the work is spread all over the body. 

143
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,666
 The same lightness and grace 

144
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,266
 descend the stairs 

145
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,140
 can be achieved by 

146
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,971
 that the big toes are the floor 

147
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,171
 first touch and the foot 

148
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,300
 from there to the heel rolls. 

149
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:12,195
 To use the foot the other way around 

150
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,905
 leads to this awkward gait 

151
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,666
 and again the support of the head remains 

152
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,350
 only the shoulder muscles left. 

153
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:26,566
 Computer work Best case - worst case 

154
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,400
 Unfortunately, one includes 

155
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,166
 Working day for many of us hardly movement. 

156
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,966
 We sit - often in front of a computer, 

157
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,400
 mostly curved, with his head so far in front, 

158
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:40,600
 like when we're upside down 

159
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,130
 wanted to dive into the screen. 

160
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,535
 If you exaggerate my Tomaš, 

161
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,600
 then they will look in the next few minutes 

162
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,700
 every now and then to the other two 

163
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,900
 "Real" people in the background. 

164
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 Both hands are usually 

165
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,605
 with outward pointing fingers. 

166
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,140
 Most mouse clicks are done 

167
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,535
 with the index finger. 

168
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,135
 You may think 

169
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:05,936
 this is incidental ... we'll see ... 

170
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,066
 A good starting point would be that 

171
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,806
 Seating principle, which we already 

172
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,166
 discussed at the bus stop. 

173
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:14,431
 So Tomaš: 

174
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,235
 "Raise your pelvis so far, 

175
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:17,966
 that the weight of the upper body 

176
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,740
 in front of the seats. " 

177
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,266
 Pretty good ! 

178
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,635
 With a little practice, Tomaš becomes 

179
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,735
 his pelvis even better 

180
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,566
 but can even set up 

181
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,300
 this partial test improved 

182
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,040
 the situation for the whole 

183
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,765
 Upper body and the head dramatically. 

184
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,666
 Now the new hand position. 

185
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,005
 The elbow shows as far as possible to the outside 

186
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,905
 and the fingers inside. 

187
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,430
 The click must now from 

188
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:46,800
 Ring and middle finger are taken over. 

189
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,166
 Now look how the combination 

190
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,935
 of the two elements - basin in 

191
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,835
 better position and more refined 

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,735
 Use of fingers and hands - 

193
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,161
 the way to sit changed. 

194
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:59,600
 First, the chaotic use of the body. 

195
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,840
 Let's improve this by 

196
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,100
 we use the legs around the pelvis 

197
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,166
 to bring up with it 

198
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,300
 the spine is upright. 

199
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,735
 The seemingly unimportant use of 

200
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,801
 Hands and fingers and the reaction 

201
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,635
 of the entire body on the 

202
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,646
 different positions. 

203
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,470
 In an ideal world you would 

204
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:31,570
 of course at a lectern 

205
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,535
 work, because the human body 

206
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,570
 really is not built for that 

207
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,705
 to sit for a long time. 

208
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:42,535
 Three fingers that save you a lot of trouble. 

209
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,970
 Like our fingers and hands 

210
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,815
 inserting not only changes our shoulders, 

211
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,270
 separates the entire body. 

212
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,706
 Let's explore this with the simple task 

213
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,265
 to lift something heavy. 

214
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,301
 In this first example Luděk uses 

215
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:57,771
 a grip of the thumb 

216
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,506
 and index finger is initiated. 

217
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,435
 See how the weight of the box 

218
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,570
 his shoulders are turning forward 

219
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,696
 and his back bends. 

220
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,540
 Let's try another strategy. 

221
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,040
 The main change in Luděks 

222
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,975
 Approach is the use 

223
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,065
 another handle. 

224
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,295
 A strong grip, from the middle finger, 

225
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,965
 Ring finger and little finger initiated. 

226
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,401
 Balance your thumb and forefingers 

227
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,470
 the weight off, but do not wear it. 

228
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:28,401
 Much more upright ... 

229
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,040
 Shoulders not rotated forward. 

230
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,806
 Excellent, Luděk! 

231
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,135
 Is it that easy? Yes! 

232
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,001
 When we pick up something heavy 

233
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:44,169
 or wear while doing optimal 

234
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,775
 Want to use body mechanics 

235
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,770
 should we use the strong grip of the 

236
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,870
 Apply three external fingers. 

237
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,540
 Balance your thumb and forefinger 

238
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,465
 the weight and should be more subtle 

239
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,740
 Tasks are used such as 

240
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,766
 a pen, tweezers, a coin, 

241
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,075
 but not to carry weight. 

242
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,701
 In another example from the 

243
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,835
 real life, we send now 

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,830
 Zdena for a shopping trip to the supermarket. 

245
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,035
 Wow, there must be something damn 

246
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,201
 be heavy in the shopping bags. 

247
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,365
 Aah, the wrong handle! 

248
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,470
 So, although she's rule 1 

249
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,335
 - feet just out - noticed, 

250
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,170
 you seem under the weight 

251
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:21,740
 to collapse the shopping bags. 

252
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,365
 Now, look how the deployment 

253
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:25,006
 strong grip of the external fingers 

254
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,200
 not just Zdena's body mechanics, 

255
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:30,601
 but transformed their whole appearance. 

256
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,835
 Would Marta use this wearing technique 

257
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,026
 always apply that would 

258
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,535
 probably with a lot of pain 

259
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,711
 ending in back and shoulders. 

260
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,770
 But what a difference 

261
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,735
 if you have the strong grip 

262
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,501
 the external finger used. 

263
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,401
 She will not be in pain 

264
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:51,010
 and the little one will become 

265
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,966
 feel much better. 

266
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:59,235
 The elbow-shoulder connection 

267
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:01,535
 Even if we follow these instructions, 

268
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,570
 ours cramp 

269
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:05,440
 Shoulder muscles sometimes. 

270
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,101
 We try to relax, 

271
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:08,671
 but without success. 

272
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,870
 Somehow, our brain seems 

273
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:12,641
 the instruction "relax shoulders" 

274
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,270
 not to understand. 

275
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,266
 Luděk found out a trick. 

276
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:22,240
 His instruction is: 

277
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,366
 "Feel your elbows hard". 

278
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,840
 "Feel your elbows hard" 

279
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,701
 works in every situation. 

280
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,741
 You have the choice: 

281
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,370
 You can do any activity with 

282
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,906
 high elbow or with deep and 

283
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:36,236
 execute heavy elbow. 

284
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,570
 You can cut vegetables with 

285
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:42,310
 raised elbows and the 

286
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,370
 Keep shoulders as close to the ear as possible, 

287
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,730
 or you can get a new one 

288
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:56,236
 Build your neck by doing 

289
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,536
 keep elbows heavy and wide. 

290
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,870
 You can with high elbows and 

291
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,905
 driving strained shoulders, 

292
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,676
 or with broad, heavy elbows 

293
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,530
 and relaxed shoulders. 

294
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,830
 Finally at the end of the day a glass of beer. 

295
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:15,241
 Luděk and Vlada experiment with 

296
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:18,336
 what we have researched so far. 

297
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,905
 The two different ways 

298
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,370
 to hold something. 

299
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:24,905
 First the weak one 

300
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,236
 Thumb-index finger grip. 

301
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:29,471
 Look how far Vladas 

302
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,170
 Shoulders and head fall forward 

303
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,310
 and do not forget: the head is 

304
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,665
 about 7-8 times as heavy as this glass of beer. 

305
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:43,675
 I suspect that Luděk and Vlada 

306
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,265
 much less pain over the years 

307
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,965
 have and their beer more 

308
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,465
 if they enjoy the 

309
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,636
 get a strong grip on the outer fingers. 

310
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,805
 Vladas shoulders and head can 

311
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,670
 on the spot and the back muscles 

312
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,301
 stay relaxed. 

313
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,305
 But I got so used to it, 

314
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,236
 to use the thumb and forefingers. 

315
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,070
 Can I never use them anymore? 

316
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,736
 Of course you can: 

317
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
 the next time you 

318
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,005
 to drink an espresso are 

319
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,305
 Thumb and forefinger again. 

320
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:35,736
 Relax before falling asleep 

321
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,936
 At the end of a long day, you want to 

322
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,570
 You can sleep well. 

323
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,936
 Zdena has learned how to do it, 

324
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,870
 by having the deepest muscles 

325
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,605
 relaxes her body. 

326
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
 It's a lot easier than you think. 

327
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:55,205
 Watch what she does. 

328
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,040
 She raises her knees and lays 

329
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,236
 put her head down so that he is on the 

330
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,270
 Skull and not on the neck. 

331
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:05,270
 Next she steers her 

332
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,736
 Attention to her breathing. 

333
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,030
 With the inhalation she brings her throat 

334
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,130
 in the position, as if they were "gh" 

335
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,465
 would say, when exhaling leaves 

336
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,600
 she her stomach and the organs 

337
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:18,510
 hang down and think 

338
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,705
 the sound "jjoohh". 

339
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,536
 Inhale with "gh", 

340
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:29,170
 Exhale with "jjoohh". 

341
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,410
 Slowly her neck relaxes 

342
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:35,400
 and head and her cross are always sinking 

343
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:37,570
 more in the mattress. 

344
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,005
 Inhale with "gh", 

345
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:44,005
 Exhale with "jjoohh". 

346
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,805
 Inhale with "gh", 

347
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,405
 Exhale with "jjoohh". 

348
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:55,505
 Inhale with "gh", 

349
00:13:55,905 --> 00:14:00,305
 Exhale with "jjoohh". 

350
00:14:02,740 --> 00:00:00,000
 Then she stretches out and falls asleep.
